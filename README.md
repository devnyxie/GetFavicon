# GetFavicon package 📦
[Pypi.org package](https://pypi.org/project/getFavicon/) 
<br/>
GetFavicon is a simple python tool to grab site's favicons. While working on favicon tool which was using [favicon](https://pypi.org/project/favicon/) python package, I've got enough inspiration to create mine due to bugs of this package. While I was sure I can create a better and faster package, I've managed to create a package with more options but speed is not much better. While original favicon's speed is around 0.6s avg, mine is 0.4s-0.5s.
